# How to implement percentage values calculation in a GridView unbound column for a group


<p>In this example, we have an ASPxGrid bound to SqlDataSource. The data source returns columns. We grouped the grid by one of them. Also, the grid contains an additional unbound column 'percent'. It contains the ratio of the 'UnitPrice' column's value to total 'UnitPrice' column's values for this group. If the grid doesn't have any groups, the 'percent' column will contain  the ratio of the 'UnitPrice' column's value to total 'UnitPrice' column's values of the grid.</p>
